            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                My name is Mário Cândido, I am a front end 
                website developer from Rio de Janeiro. 
                I have knowledge of HTML, CSS with Sass 
                and Tailwind, as well as Javascript with 
                ReactJs.       
                       
                I'm looking for my first opportunity as a 
                frontend developer and this could be your 
                opportunity to hire a developer willing to 
                prove their value and add content to your 
                company.
            </p>
            <h3>My background and experiences</h3>
            <p>
                As previously stated, I am a frontend 
                developer and use the most used technologies 
                on the market. Furthermore, I can add 
                knowledge as a systems analyst, as I have 
                8 years of experience in the area. I'm 
                looking for a career transition and this 
                could be the opportunity to recruit a young 
                developer who is very determined to always 
                deliver the best to his team.
                
                There are probably other better professionals
                than me, but certainly none will have the 
                same willpower to add value to you.
